## Basics
- In Shiny, server logic is expressed using **reactive programming** (*elegant powerful programming paradigm!*)
- Very different to writing a script that runs from start to end
- Key idea: specify a graph of dependencies so that when an input changes, all related outputs (throughout the script) are automatically updated
- **Reactive programming** makes flow of an app considerably simpler


## The server function
- "Guts" of every shiny app below

```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-2, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(shiny)

# front end interface (Html)
ui <- fluidPage()

# back end logic
server <- function(input, output, session) {}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

- `ui` simple because every user gets same html
- `server` more complicated because every user needs independent version of the app (i.e., A using slider should not affect B's ui)
- `server()` is invoked each time new session starts
  - has three parameters: `input`, `output`, `session` that are created by Shiny (not by us!) when session starts  connecting to specific session



## Input & output
- `input` argument is list-like object that contains all the **input data sent from the browser**, named according to the **input ID**
  - e.g., `numericInput("count", label = "Number of values", value = 100)` generates `input$count`
  - `input` is selective about who is allowed to read from i
    - namely you must be in a reactive context created by a function like `renderText()` or `reactive()`
    - these functions allow for outputs to automatically update when an input changes

- `output` is similar to input: a list-like object containing ouputs named according to `output ID`
  - Difference: `output` used for sending output instead of receiving input (always in concert with **render function** as below)
  
```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-3, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(textOutput("greeting"))

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText("Hello human!")
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

- **render function** sets up special reactive context that automatically tracks what inputs the output uses AND converts output of R code into HTML suitable for display on a web page
- Common errors: Forgeting render function or reading from outputs (see [here](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#output))


## Reactive programming (1)
* How does reactivity work? Let's look at the example below!

```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-4, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!")
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

- Big idea in Shiny: you don’t need to tell an output when to update, because Shiny automatically figures it out for you!
- Shiny performs the action every time we update `input$name`
- Code doesn't tell Shiny to create string and send it to the browser, but instead informs Shiny how it could create the string if it needs to
  - It's up to Shiny when (and even if!) the code should be run
- App provides Shiny with **recipes**, not giving it commands

## Reactive programming (2)

- **Imperative vs. Declarative programming** ([Chapter 3.3.1](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#imperative-vs-declarative-programming))
  - Imperative code: "Make me a sandwich"; Declarative code: "Ensure there is a sandwich in the refrigerator whenever I look inside of it"
  - Imperative code is assertive; declarative code is passive-aggressive
- **Laziness**  ([Chapter 3.3.2](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#laziness))
  - Strength of declarative programming in Shiny: app will only ever do the minimal amount of work needed to update the output controls that you can currently see

## Reactive programming (3): The reactive graph
- Most R code can be read from top to bottom (= order of execution)... but doesn't work in Shiny
- Look at **reactive graph** describing how inputs and outputs are connected to understand order of execution
- @fig-graph-simple describes app above

```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-5, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
#| label: fig-graph-simple
#| fig-cap: "The reactive graph shows how the inputs and outputs are connected"
knitr::include_graphics("resources/graph-1b.png", dpi = 300)
```

- Graph tells you that `greeting` will need to be recomputed whenever `name` is changed (`greeting` has a reactive dependency on `name`)
- Quick high-level sketch of the reactive graph to remind you how all the pieces fit together


## Reactive programming (4): Reactive expressions
- Reactive expressions take inputs and produce outputs so they have a shape that combines features of both inputs and outputs
- Think of them as a tool to reduce duplication in your reactive code by introducing additional nodes into the reactive graph (see @fig-graph-expression)

```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-6, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
#| label: fig-graph-expression
#| fig-cap: "A reactive expression is drawn with angles on both sides because it connects inputs to outputs"
knitr::include_graphics("resources/graph-2b.png", dpi = 300)
```

- Below we add one to the app above:


```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-7, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  string <- reactive(paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!"))
  output$greeting <- renderText(string())
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```


## Reactive programming (5): Executation order
- The order your Shiny code run is solely determined by the reactive graph (different from classic R code)
- We could flip code in server function below, but don't because harder to understand

```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-8, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText(string())
  string <- reactive(paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!"))
}
```


## Reactive programming (6): Exercises
1. Can you spot errors in the code of the different servers below? 

```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-9, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# UI
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

# SERVERS
server1 <- function(input, output, server) {
  input$greeting <- renderText(paste0("Hello ", name))
}

server2 <- function(input, output, server) {
  greeting <- paste0("Hello ", input$name)
  output$greeting <- renderText(greeting)
}

server3 <- function(input, output, server) {
  output$greting <- paste0("Hello", input$name)
}



```



2.  Draw the reactive graph for the following server functions:
    ```{r}
    server1 <- function(input, output, session) {
      c <- reactive(input$a + input$b)
      e <- reactive(c() + input$d)
      output$f <- renderText(e())
    }
    server2 <- function(input, output, session) {
      x <- reactive(input$x1 + input$x2 + input$x3)
      y <- reactive(input$y1 + input$y2)
      output$z <- renderText(x() / y())
    }
    server3 <- function(input, output, session) {
      d <- reactive(c() ^ input$d)
      a <- reactive(input$a * 10)
      c <- reactive(b() / input$c) 
      b <- reactive(a() + input$b)
    }
    ```
    
    

## Reactive expressions
- [Chapter 3.4](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#reactive-expressions-1) is recommend reading
- **Reactive expressions** are important because...
  - they give Shiny more information so that it can do less recomputation when inputs change
  - make apps more efficient and easier for humans to understand by simplifying reactive graph
- Are a like inputs since you can use the results of a reactive expression in an output
- Are like outputs since they depend on inputs and automatically know when they need updating
- Helpful vocabulary: **Producers** refer to reactive inputs and expressions; **Consumers** refer to reactive expressions and outputs (@fig-prod-consumer)

```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-10, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
#| label: fig-prod-consumer
#| fig-cap: "Inputs and expressions are reactive producers; expressions and outputs are reactive consumers"

knitr::include_graphics("resources/producers-consumers.png", dpi = 300)
```



## Controlling timing of evaluation
- Won't dive deeper but there are additional helpful functions (see [Chapter 3.5](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#controlling-timing-of-evaluation))
- `reactiveTimer()`
  - a reactive expression that has a dependency on a hidden input: **the current time**
  - Use reactiveTimer() to invalidate a reactive expression itself more often than it otherwise would
  - See code example in [Chapter[3.5.1](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#timed-invalidation)
- Sometimes you might want to require the user to opt-in to performing the expensive calculation by requiring them to click a `actionButton()`
  - We need `eventReactive()`, which has two arguments: the first argument specifies what to take a dependency on, and the second argument specifies what to compute. That allows this app to only compute x1() and x2() when `actionButton()` is clicked
  - See code example in [Chapter[3.5.2](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#on-click)  



## Observers
https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#observers
- So far focus on what's happening inside the app
- Sometimes you need to reach outside cause side-effects to happen elsewhere in the world
  - e.g., saving file to shared network drive, sending data to a web API, updating a database, or (most commonly) printing a debugging message to the console
- Such actions don't affect how app looks, so avoid using an output and a render function
- **observer** is the solution to such problems
- One simple way is to use `observeEvent()` function

- `observeEvent()` is similar to `eventReactive()`
- Arguments: `eventExpr` specifies input or expression to take a dependency on; `handlerExpr` is code that will be run
- Differences between `observeEvent()` and `eventReactive()`
  - result of `observeEvent()` is not assigned to variable so you can't refer to it from other reactive consumers




## Loading things in Shiny apps

### When is code run?
* When is code in a shiny app run? ([Source](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson5/#:~:text=Shiny%20will%20run%20code%20placed,the%20life%20of%20the%20app.))

![alt text](resources/run-once.png)
![alt text](resources/run-once-per-user.png)
![alt text](resources/run-many-times.png)

* Q: So where shall we put the function to load the dataset?
* Q: What problem might occur if we place certain code wrongly, e.g., load the data in the server or render function?





### Where to load things
* Code outside ```server <- function(input, output) {}``` is run once, when you launch your app
* Code inside ```server <- function(input, output) {}``` is run once each time a user visits your app
* Code inside ```render*``` functions is rerun constantly (not only when user changes widget value, see [reactivity(https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/build/understanding-reactivity/)]) 
* That means...
    + Load **Source scripts, libraries, and data** outside of ```server``` function (at the beginning)
        + Store data in ```www/``` folder in your app directory
        + Access with ```read.table("www/swiss.csv", sep=",")```
        + Access online data by inserting the url into the ```read*``` function (e.g. ```read.table()```)
    + **User specific objects** (e.g. object that records user's session information) are defined inside shinyServer’s unnamed function, but outside of any render* calls
        + e.g. user registers himself, user data as input data (compare income)
    + **Code/objects that are affected by choices in widgets** must be placed within the a ```render*``` function
        + Shiny reruns code in a ```render*``` chunk each time a user changes a widget mentioned in the chunk
* **Avoid** placing code within render function that does not need to be there... for performance reasons!


## Data storage
- Copy Jonas's part on data storage





## Summary

To build reactive shiny apps...

* Use `*Output` functions to place reactive objects in the UI (webpage)
* Use `render*` functions to let R build output objects (on the server)
    + Render functions are located in `server <- function(input, output) {...})` 
    + R expressions are surrounded by braces, `{}` in `render*` functions
    + Outputs of `render*` are saved in the `output` list, with one entry for each reactive object in your app
    + Reactivity by including an `input` values in a `render*` expression
* Often times you will adapt/modify [examples](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) that you find online

## Summary




- Reactive output automatically responds when users change widget input values stored in list `inputs$...`
- BUT we need to tell the server what to do with the input values in the server function
- `server <- function(input, output) {**construction of output objects in here**})` 
* **Describe the server how to build the object**
    + The object will be reactive if the code that builds it calls a widget value
    + `output$distPlot <- renderPlot({...})`
      - Resulting output is stored in list `output$...`
- render functions (e.g. `renderPlot({...})`) wrap outputs and correspond to the type or reactive output
- render functions produce new output when input values in them change

## Render functions

    + render functions wrap outputs and correspond to the type or reactive output
        + `renderImage({...})` creates images (saved as a link to a source file)
        + `renderPlot({...})` creates plots
        + `renderPrint({...})` creates any printed output
        + `renderTable({...})` creates data frame, matrix, other table like structures
        + `renderText({...})` creates character strings
        + `renderUI({...})` creates a Shiny tag object or HTML





### SERVER: Example
* Use example from app with datatable!

```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-11, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ui <- fluidPage( 
titlePanel("Displaying reactive output"),
sidebarLayout( 
    sidebarPanel( 
      selectInput("selection", label = h3("Select box"), 
        choices = list("Fertility" = "Fertility", 
                       "Agriculture" = "Agriculture", 
                       "Examination" = "Examination", 
                       "Education" = "Education", 
                       "Catholic" = "Catholic", 
                       "Infant.Mortality" = "Infant.Mortality"),
        selected = 1) # Selection is a variablename!
      ),
    mainPanel( # Draw main panel
      plotOutput("distPlot") # Put the output - a plot - into the main panel
    )
  ) 
)

server <- function(input, output) { 
     
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({ 
      x    <-   swiss[, input$selection] # USING WIDGET VALUE
      hist(x, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white', 
           xlab=input$selection, 
           main="Swiss French Provinces Fertility and Socioeconomic Indicators (1888) Data")
  }) 
} 

shinyApp(ui=ui, server = server)
```


* Launch the app
```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-12, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# ui.R
runApp(display.mode = "showcase")
```

* Launch it on the server!
```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-13, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
deployApp()
```





### Exercise: SERVER
1. Use the code below (we saw that before). 
2. Add another reactive output that displays the selection made in the select box as text, e.g. "Infant.mortality", below the plot in the mainpanel.
    + Tipp: You will need the output function `textOutput(...)` to show the text in the UI. And you will need the function `renderText({...})` to build the output on the server.
3. If you like add another another output.


```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-14, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Displaying reactive output"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput("selection", label = h3("Select box"),
                  choices = list("Fertility" = "Fertility",
                                 "Agriculture" = "Agriculture",
                                 "Examination" = "Examination",
                                 "Education" = "Education",
                                 "Catholic" = "Catholic",
                                 "Infant.Mortality" = "Infant.Mortality"), selected = 1)
    ),

    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("distPlot")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    x    <-   swiss[, input$selection]
    hist(x, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white', xlab=input$selection, main="Swiss French Provinces Fertility and Socioeconomic Indicators (1888) Data")
  })

}

shinyApp(ui=ui, server = server)
```

```{r 04-server-reactive-programming-15, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Displaying reactive output"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput("selection", label = h3("Select box"),
                  choices = list("Fertility" = "Fertility",
                                 "Agriculture" = "Agriculture",
                                 "Examination" = "Examination",
                                 "Education" = "Education",
                                 "Catholic" = "Catholic",
                                 "Infant.Mortality" = "Infant.Mortality"), selected = 1)
    ),

    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("distPlot"),
      textOutput("text1")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    x    <-   swiss[, input$selection]
    hist(x, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white', xlab=input$selection, main="Swiss French Provinces Fertility and Socioeconomic Indicators (1888) Data")
  })
  output$text1 <- renderText({
    input$selection
  })
}
shinyApp(ui=ui, server = server)
```
