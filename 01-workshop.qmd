## Script & material {#material}
- **Literature**: See syllabus.
- **Website/script**: https://bookdown.org/paul/shiny_workshop/
	- Find it: Google "shiny paul jonas"
	- Document = slides  + script (Zoom in/out with `STRG + mousewheel`)
	- **Code**: can all be found in the script
	- **Data**: can usually be downloaded over links in the script. If not we'll share the files.
	- Full screen: F11
	- **Navigation**: TOCs on left and right
	- Search document (upper left)
	- Document generated with [quarto](https://quarto.org/)
- **Motivation**: Have a go-to script for participants (and ourselves!)
- **Content**: Mixture of theory, lab sessions, exercises and pure code examples for discussion




## Strategy & Goals
- **Strategy**: From the simple to the complex, slowly building up a complex Shiny app that includes various aspects (tabulate data, modelling and descriptive graphs, mapping)

- **Goals**: By the end of the course participants will:
	- know what the structure of a Shiny application looks like
	- understand the basics of reactive programming for interactive data analysis and visualization
	- be comfortable to use R Shiny to build their own interactive applications
	- have learned about different ways to launch their Shiny application






  






## Online vs. offline

* **Negative**
    + Screen fatigue
    + Can't run around to check your code
    + Less engaging, less social
    + Voice
    + Screen sharing &less screen space than classroom 
* **Positive**
    + We see the Shiny app how its mostly consumed
    ;-) (on a screen)
        + Remember: "How is your Shiny app consumed (smartphone)?"
    + Participation from everywhere
* **Rule(s)**: Please keep your camera online if possible!
  + Distracting animals/children/partners are a welcome distraction!
  + Yawning, leaving, looking bored etc. allowed!
  + Use a virtual background if you like!
  







  
    
## Recommended readings

- **Important**: Our workshop does not require any prior reading. 
- However, our schedule is primarily based on two textbooks which we generally recommend for further reading (see references on website):
	- @wickham2021mastering: Mastering Shiny: Build Interactive Apps, Reports, and Dashboards Powered by R. Accessible online at: https://mastering-shiny.org/. 
	- Fay, Colin, Rochette, SÃ©bastien, Guyader, Vincent, and Girard, Cervan (2022): Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps. Accessible online at: https://engineering-shiny.org/.













## Software we will use
- Open-source software! (Q: Why?)
- R [@rcoreteam2023]^[Creators: [Core contributors](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)  and thousands of package authors.]
  - only viable competitor is Python
  - Install the necessary packages using the code below.

```{r workshop-1, echo=FALSE, results='asis', cache=FALSE}
options(width = 300)

# format pacman string
pkg_fmt <- paste0(
  "pacman::p_load(c(\n",
  paste(paste("  ", packages), collapse = ",\n"),
  "\n))"
)

pkg_fmt <- sprintf("```{r}\n%s\n```", pkg_fmt)

pander::pander(pkg_fmt)
```

- Shiny [@chang2020; @wickham2021mastering]
- Ggplot2^[Creators: https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2] [@wickham2016]
* Plotly^[Creators: https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js; https://github.com/ropensci/plotly] [@sievert2020]
* Note: Ideally cite the software you use in your research especially when it is open-source (e.g., run `citation("ggplot2")`)
