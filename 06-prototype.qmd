## Planning and building a prototype

Learning outcomes/objectives: Learn...

-   How to come up with the user interface of a prototype dashboard

-   How to pep up user interfaces with custom theming

## Basic dashboard structure

-   In the last section, we explored ways to come up with a basic Shiny app design
-   Here, I prototype my Guerry dashboard using the `bs4Dash` R package
-   We can run a minimal example of a Shiny dashboard:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ui <- dashboardPage(
	header = dashboardHeader(),
	sidebar = dashboardSidebar(),
	body = dashboardBody(),
	controlbar = dashboardControlbar(),
	footer = dashboardFooter(),
	title = "Guerry Dashboard"
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
	
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

![Dashboard structure](resources/dashboard-structure.png)

-   Each argument passed to `dashboardPage` corresponds to one element on the figure above

-   Accordingly, we can focus on one element at a time

-   Don't forget you can consult the documentation to get the hang of what to do with each dashboard element:

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    ?dashboardPage
    ```

### Header

-   The dashboard header is visible at all times
-   It usually contains elements that are important to the entire app, such as global settings, important links or affiliations
-   By default it already contains a switch to control the dark mode (try it out, it works out of the box!)
-   In the Guerry case, we can keep it simple: a workshop title + logo and a GESIS logo that leads to the GESIS homepage

```{r}
header <- dashboardHeader(
  span(style = "display: inline-block; width: 100%;"),
  a(
    class = "logo",
    href = "https://gesis.org/",
    img(src = "gesis-logo.png", style = "height: 1.8em;")
  ),
  title = tagList(
    img(src = "workshop-logo.png", width = 35, height = 35),
    span("Guerry Dashboard")
  ),
  skin = "light"
)
```

### Sidebar

-   The sidebar is the main element to navigate a dashboard
-   It contains the names of all subsections of a dashboard
-   It can be expanded or collapsed, or it can idle in a 'minified' state
-   A sidebar consists of a `sidebarMenu` which in turn consists of multiple `menuItem`s

```{r}
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar(
    id = "sidebar",
    sidebarMenu(
      id = "sidebarMenu",
      menuItem(tabName = "intro", text = "Introduction", icon = icon("home")),
      menuItem(tabName = "exp", text = "Explore data", icon = icon("map")),
      menuItem(tabName = "insp", text = "Inspect data", icon = icon("table")),
      menuItem(tabName = "model", text = "Model data", icon = icon("chart-line")),
      flat = TRUE
    ),
    minified = TRUE,
    collapsed = TRUE,
    fixed = FALSE,
    skin = "light"
)
```

### Controlbar

-   The controlbar is an optional secondary sidebar which is mostly used for global options or theming
-   It can be toggled using the 'grid' symbol on the top right
-   It can take any type of UI element, it's basically just an additional space for anything concerning the entire app

```{r}
controlbar <- dashboardControlbar(div(class = "p-3", skinSelector()), skin = "light")
```

### Footer

-   The footer typically contains the app's colophon, e.g., for mentioning authors, sharing links or funding information
-   Like the controlbar, the footer is an optional element that can also be left empty
-   In this case, I added a few infos about myself here:

```{r}
footer <- dashboardFooter(
	left = span(
		"This dashboard was created by Jonas Lieth and Paul Bauer. Find the source code",
		a("here.", href = "https://github.com/paulcbauer/shiny_workshop/tree/main/shinyapps/guerry"),
		"It is based on data from the",
		a("Guerry R package.", href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Guerry/index.html")
	)
)
```

### Body

-   The body contains the main contents of the dashboard

-   The visible part of the body changes when a sidebar tab is clicked

-   The body consists of a call to `tabItems()` which in turn consists of multiple `tabItem()`s

```{r}
body <- dashboardBody(
	tabItems(
		# tab contents go here: tabItem(...)
	)
)
```

-   Don't forget you can always run the application to see how changes affect the app:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ui <- bs4Dash::dashboardPage(
	header = header,
	sidebar = sidebar,
	body = body,
	controlbar = controlbar,
	footer = footer,
	title = "Guerry Dashboard"
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
	
}

shiny::shinyApp(ui, server)
```

**Exercise:** Consult the `bs4Dash` documentation and change the following aspects of the dashboard:

1.  Remove the dark/light mode toggle

2.  Add text or other UI elements below the sidebar items

3.  Replace the controlbar toggle icon with an icon showing gears

4.  Add an element that you think might be a nice addition to the dashboard layout

## Building a prototype

-   Here, we fill the empty canvases inside the dashboard body
-   During prototyping, only the UI is assembled
-   Functionality (i.e. the server function) is then added later
-   Essential functions to structure Shiny bodies:
    -   `bs4Dash::box()`: boxes hold UI elements like texts or plots
    -   `fluidRow()`: align items (e.g. boxes) in a row
    -   `column()`: divide fluid rows into multiple columns
    -   `hr()`: seperate elements using a horizontal line
-   A box can look like this:

```{r eval=F}
tabBox(
	title = "Box title",
	type = "tabs",
	footer = "Box footer",
	status = "primary",
	closable = TRUE,
	maximizable = TRUE,
	icon = icon("box"),
	elevation = 4,
	boxToolSize = "lg",
	label = boxLabel("label", "primary"),
	dropdownMenu = boxDropdown(
		boxDropdown("Chicken", icon = icon("drumstick-bite"), id = "chicken"),
		boxDropdown("Cookie", icon = icon("cookie-bite"), id = "cookie"),
		boxDropdown("Bacon", icon = icon("bacon"), id = "bacon"),
		boxDropdown("Carrot", icon = icon("carrot", id = "carrot"))
	),
	sidebar = boxSidebar("sidebar"),
	tabPanel(
		title = "Tab 1",
		"This is the box content. A plot, a text, a table, or a figure could go here."
	),
	tabPanel(
		title = "Tab 2",
		"This is the second tab of this box."
	)
)
```

![A fully customized box](resources/box.png)

### Landing page

-   A [landing page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page) is the page a user lands on

-   Supposed to be: an attention catcher, a guide, and an introduction

-   Useful for Dashboards, but probably over the top for more concise Shiny apps

-   `bs4Dash` supports some cool utilities for landing pages; `shinyLP` is another cool package to design landing pages

    -   Here, we use a [Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/) and an [Accordion](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/#accordion-example)

    -   We use `column` and `fluidRow` to align and scale the contents

-   Note: The `tabName` argument of the `tabItem` must be the same as the `tabName` argument of the `menuItem` in the sidebar

```{r}
intro <- tabItem(
  tabName = "intro",
  jumbotron(
  	title = "The Guerry Dashboard",
  	lead = "A Shiny app to explore the classic Guerry dataset.",
  	status = "info",
  	btnName = NULL
  ),
  fluidRow(
  	column(width = 1),
    column(

### Data explorer

-   Supposed to enable exploration of the spatial structure of the Guerry dataset

-   Objectives:

    -   Focus on mapping

    -   No more words than necessary

    -   Embrace interactivity

-   We use UI inputs from the `shinyWidgets` package

    -   consult `?pickerInput` and `?radioGroupButtons` to get to know all the options of these extended widgets

-   To improve explorability, we insert a Leaflet map

-   We maximize the mapping area and minimize everything else

-   **Question:** Which inputs and outputs are created in the code below and what is their purpose?

```{r eval=F}
exp <- tabItem(
  tabName = "exp", # must correspond to related menuItem name
  fluidRow(
    column(
      width = 4, # must be between 1 and 12
      box(
        title = "Data selection",
        status = "primary",
        width = 12,
        shinyWidgets::pickerInput(
          "exp_select",
          label = "Select a variable",
          choices = setNames(variables, sapply(txts, "[[", "title")),
          options = shinyWidgets::pickerOptions(liveSearch = TRUE)
        ),
        uiOutput("exp_desc")
      ),
      box(
        title = "Map configuration",
        status = "primary",
        width = 12,
        shinyWidgets::radioGroupButtons(
          "exp_aggr",
          label = "Aggregation level",
          choices = c("Departments", "Regions"),
          selected = "Departments",
          individual = TRUE,
          checkIcon = list(
            yes = tags$i(class = "fa fa-circle", style = "color: #FED22B;"),
            no = tags$i(class = "fa fa-circle-o", style = "color: #FED22B;")
          )
        ),
        shinyWidgets::pickerInput(
          "exp_pal",
          label = "Color palette",
          choices = pals,
          selected = "Plasma"
        ) # end input
      ) # end box
    ), # end column
    column(
      width = 8,
      box(
        id = "exp_box",
        status = "primary",
        headerBorder = FALSE,
        collapsible = FALSE,
        width = 12,
        leaflet::leafletOutput("exp_map", height = "800px", width = "100%")
      ) # end box
    ) # end column
  ) # end fluidRow
) # end tabItem
```

### Data inspector

-   Many Shiny apps include their raw datasets to inspect and filter the data more liberally

-   The `DT` package is a widespread extension for advanced table UI's

-   Additionally, we provide inputs to filter variables and change the aggregation level

```{r eval=F}
insp <- tabItem(
  tabName = "insp",
  fluidRow(
    shinyWidgets::pickerInput(
      "insp_select",
      label = "Filter variables",
      choices = setNames(variables, sapply(txts, "[[", "title")),
      options = shinyWidgets::pickerOptions(
        actionsBox = TRUE,
        windowPadding = c(30, 0, 0, 0),
        liveSearch = TRUE,
        selectedTextFormat = "count",
        countSelectedText = "{0} variables selected",
        noneSelectedText = "No filters applied"
      ),
      inline = TRUE,
      multiple = TRUE
    ),
    div(style = "width: 20px;"),
    shinyWidgets::radioGroupButtons(
      "insp_aggr",
      label = "Aggregation level",
      choices = c("Departments", "Regions"),
      selected = "Departments",
      individual = TRUE,
      checkIcon = list(
        yes = tags$i(class = "fa fa-circle", style = "color: #FED22B;"),
        no = tags$i(class = "fa fa-circle-o", style = "color: #FED22B;")
      )
    )
  ),
  hr(),
  DT::dataTableOutput("insp_table")
)
```

### Data modeller

-   Modelling data is arguably a very different task than exploring when designing a dashboard

-   Objectives:

    -   Focus on information density

    -   Avoid overspecific technical jargon

    -   Avoid ["reactive infernos"](https://engineering-shiny.org/common-app-caveats.html#reactivity-is-awesome-until-it-is-not)

-   In other words: We want to build a Shiny app that's concise, but doesn't flood you with choices, dependencies and things you don't understand

-   We designed this tab to be organized in four quadrants:

    1.  Data selection

    2.  Statistical distributions

    3.  Regression modelling

    4.  Model diagnostics

-   The first quadrant, **data selection**, allows you to select one dependent variable and several independent variables

-   You can also standardize the variables if needed (makes sense for some variables)

-   There probably are thousands of more potential options, but most of them are likely too much for a single app

-   Note: Options are only applied after clicking on an "Apply" button. This can be a good idea to prevent a "reactive inferno" when adding the server function.

```{r}
quad1 <- box(
	width = 12,
	title = "Select variables",
	status = "primary",
	shinyWidgets::pickerInput(
		"model_x",
		label = "Select a dependent variable",
		choices = setNames(variables, sapply(txts, "[[", "title")),
		options = shinyWidgets::pickerOptions(liveSearch = TRUE),
		selected = "Literacy"
	),
	shinyWidgets::pickerInput(
		"model_y",
		label = "Select independent variables",
		choices = setNames(variables, sapply(txts, "[[", "title")),
		options = shinyWidgets::pickerOptions(
			actionsBox = TRUE,
			liveSearch = TRUE,
			selectedTextFormat = "count",
			countSelectedText = "{0} variables selected",
			noneSelectedText = "No variables selected"
		),
		multiple = TRUE,
		selected = "Commerce"
	),
	shinyWidgets::prettyCheckbox(
		"model_std",
		label = "Standardize variables?",
		value = FALSE,
		status = "primary",
		shape = "curve"
	),
	hr(),
	actionButton(
		"refresh",
		label = "Apply changes",
		icon = icon("refresh"),
		flat = TRUE
	)
)
```

-   In the second quadrant, **statistical distributions**, we decide to insert a pair plot (see the `GGally` package)

-   We keep the plot interactive using the `plotly` package

```{r}
quad2 <- box(
	width = 12,
	title = "Pair diagram",
	status = "primary",
	plotly::plotlyOutput("pairplot")
)
```

-   In the third quadrant, **regression modelling**, we introduce a new concept: tab boxes

-   Regression can be hard to visualize concisely

-   Tab boxes help to use space efficiently

-   Each tab is denoted using the `tabPanel()` function

```{r}
quad3 <- tabBox(
  status = "primary",
  type = "tabs",
  width = 12,
  tabPanel(
    title = "Plot: Coefficients",
    plotly::plotlyOutput("coefficientplot")
  ),
  tabPanel(
    title = "Plot: Scatterplot",
    plotly::plotlyOutput("scatterplot")
  ),
  tabPanel(
    title = "Table: Model",
    htmlOutput("tableregression")
  )
)
```

-   Finally, for the studied user, we insert a fourth quadrant: **Model diagnostics**

-   

## Theming

-   Shiny apps look a bit lackluster by default

-   Especially in case of corporate designs, theming is an important issue

-   Shiny has some really cool extensions for amping up your UI, e.g.: `bslib`, `fresh`, `waiter`, `shinyWidgets`, `shinyjs`, ...

### Global themes

-   `bs4Dash` can easily be themed using the `fresh` package

-   Workflow:

    -   Create a theme using `fresh::create_theme`

    -   Add theming elements, such as layout, colors, fonts

    -   Pass the theme object as an argument to `dashboardPage`

-   Tip: Type in `fresh::bs4dash_` in the RStudio console and explore fresh's theming elements

```{r}
dash_theme <- create_theme(
  bs4dash_status(
    primary = "#58748f",
    secondary = "#666666",
    info = "#E6EAEE",
    danger = "#BF616A",
    warning = "#F06400",
    light = "#F4F4F2",
    dark = "#2c2c25"
  ),
  bs4dash_layout(
    font_size_root = "5rem",
    main_bg = "#FDFDFD",
    sidebar_width = "350px"
  ),
  bs4dash_sidebar_light(bg = "#F4F4F2", color = "#000"),
  bs4dash_sidebar_dark(bg = "#2c2c25", color = "#FFF"),
  bs4dash_color(
  	orange = "#F06400",
    white = "#E6EAEE",
    black = "#000",
    gray_600 = "#666",
    gray_800 = "#333",
    gray_900 = "#000",
    blue = "#58748f"
  ),
  bs4dash_font(
    family_sans_serif = "Verdana",
    family_base = "Georgia",
    family_monospace = "Courier New"
  )
)
```

### Spinners

-   A lack of feedback in graphical user interfaces can lead to frustration

-   In such cases, spinners can be an elegant solution

-   There are many Shiny extensions that support spinners: shinycssloaders, shinybusy, waiter

-   `bs4Dash` and `waiter` work particularly well together:

    -   Call `tags$head(use_waiter())` at the beginning of `dashboardBody`

    -   Assemble a preloader and pass it as an argument to the `dashboardPage`

```{r eval = FALSE}
preloader <- list(
  html = tagList(spin_wave(), "Loading ..."),
  color = "#B3DDFE"
)

ui <- dashboardPage(
	...,
	body = dashboardBody(
		tags$head(use_waiter()),
		...
	),
	preloader = preloader
)
```

-   Tip: You can preview what spinners look like through the `preview_spinner()` function or by visiting <https://jslth.shinyapps.io/waiter-gallery/>

### Custom styling

-   Shiny apps can look good without a single line of non-R code

-   However, to give an app the final touch, it's hard to get around CSS

-   Not least, Shiny apps are built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so it's naturally a good idea to know the essentials

-   The `bs4Dash::box()` applies a lot of styling behind the scenes and we can inspect what exactly is happening by printing its returned object:

```{r}
bs4Dash::box()
```

-   [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) (Cascading Style Sheets) is a computer language that is used to style HTML documents

-   HTML provides the containers, CSS styles them

-   We can write HTML and CSS easily from within R using the `htmltools` package (see `?builder` and `?browsable`)

```{r}
browsable(div(
	div(
		"This is an HTML container without styling"
	),
	div(
		"This is an HTML container with CSS styling",
		style = "
			background-color: green;
			color: white;
			border-radius: 10px;
			display: inline-block;
			padding: 5px;
			transform: rotate(5deg);
			margin-top: 15px;
			font-family: Verdana;
		"
	)
))
```

-   CSS is usually defined using classes or IDs
    -   IDs are unique identifiers for a single UI elements and are specified using a hashtag `#`
    -   Classes can be given to multiple UI elements and are specified using a dot `.`

```{r}
browsable(div(
	tags$style(
		"
		#id {
			color: red;
		}
		
		.cls {
			color: green;
		}
		"
	),
	div("This div has an id", id = "id"),
	div("This div has a class", class = "cls")
))
```

-   A complete reference of CSS can be found in the [Mozilla developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)

-   CSS can either be defined using inline CSS (`tags$style`) or an external CSS file

-   In the Guerry app, we include a CSS file which takes care of some styling:

    -   Add a folder called "www" in your app directory

    -   Add a file called "styles.css" to that folder

    -   Paste the CSS code below

    -   In R, add: `tags$head(includeCSS("www/styles.css"))` to the `dashboardBody`

```{r eval=FALSE}
/* remove white space around maps in boxes */
#exp_box .card-header, #exp_box .card-body {
  padding: 0em;
}

/* create a nicely aligned hover effect for logos */
a.logo {
  text-decoration: none;
  background-color: transparent;
  display: inline-flex;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  padding-top: 1em;
  padding-bottom: 1em;
  padding-left: 0.5em;

-   Tip: Use the "Inspect" tool in Firefox / Chrome

    -   Interactive visualization of a websites source code

    -   Lets you manipulate single UI elements in real time

    -   Makes you somewhat understand HTML and CSS more in-depth

![The Inspect tool in Firefox](resources/inspect.png)

**Exercise:** What changes after we include the external CSS file? Pinpoint the UI elements that are amended by the CSS file using the Inspect tool

**Exercise:** Using the tools above, change one of the sidebar tabs that we introduced.

-   Add better theming (colors, fonts, text styling, ...)

-   Add UI elements (e.g. using the `shinyWidgets`, `bs4Dash` or `shinyBS` packages)

-   Change the scale and configuration of UI elements

-   Look around the [![](resources/awesome-logo.svg)](https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions#ui-components) list of Shiny extensions and experiment with different UI components
