# Paul's good practices

## Use Large Language Models (LLMs)




# Jonas' good practices

## Use the browser inspector

- Browser inspectors are an extremely powerful tool that goes far beyond the scope of this workshop
- It can be used to take a deep look at a website
  - What colors and fonts are used?
  - How would the Shiny app look like on different screen sizes?
  - How would the Shiny app look like to color-blind people?
  - How are UI elements translated to HTML and CSS?
  - How are widths and heights translated to pixels?
  - Which HTTP requests are sent when running the Shiny app?
  - Does my website evoke any client-side errors?
  - ... and a lot more

### Browser inspectors in the wild

- Every popular browser has its own implementation of an inspector
  - [Firefox Page Inspector](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/)
  - [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools)
  - [Opera Web Inspector](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/testing/)
  - [Edge Inspect Tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-en/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/css/inspect)
  - [Safari Web Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-developer-tools/web-inspector)

![Simulating an iPad view using the Firefox Page Inspector](resources/firefox-inspect.png)
  

### Pros and Cons  

- Inspectors are useful for:
  - Conveying an understanding of essential HTML and CSS
  - Fine-tuning the UI of a Shiny app
  - Implementing corporate designs
- Inspectors are **excessive** if:
  - The goal is primarily to get a functioning app
  - Exploring a new elaborate tool beyond Shiny is a bit too much


## Organize your code

- Shiny code becomes messy **really** quick!
- It is even more important than in normal code to keep code clean and tidy
- Why should you organize your code?
  - It is easier for colleagues to quickly grasp what your code does
  - It is easier for you to get back to your project after some time
  - Programming with organized code is much faster and much more fun


### Functional programming
- Wrap code in functions if:
  - It is repeated more than two times
  - It is complex and might profit from abstraction
- Bad:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
exp(mean(log(iris$Sepal.Length)))
exp(mean(log(iris$Sepal.Width)))
exp(mean(log(iris$Petal.Length)))
exp(mean(log(iris$Petal.Width)))
```
- Good:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
geometric_mean <- function(x) exp(mean(log(x)))
summarize(iris, across(where(is.numeric), geometric_mean))
```
  
### Stick to a style guide
- Adopting a consistent coding style drastically improves readability for yourself and contributors
- The [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/) and [lintr](https://lintr.r-lib.org/) packages automatically check your code for style inconsistencies, bad practices, and possible syntactic/semantic errors
- The following code is valid, but deciphering what's going on might take a while
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui<-fluidPage(selectInput("var"
            ,"Variable",names(mtcars))
  ,numericInput("bins","bins",10,min= 1),plotOutput("hist"))
server<-
function(
input,output,session
) {
  data<-
    reactive(
             mtcars[[input$var]]
    )
  output$hist<-
    renderPlot(
    {hist(data()
          ,breaks=input$bins
          ,main=input$var)},res =96
)}
```

  
### Annotate your code

- Even in smaller apps, Shiny code is multiple hundred lines long
- RStudio annotations can help navigate large R code files

```{r}
# Header 1 ----
## Header 1.1 ----
### Header 1.1.1 ----
### Header 1.1.2 ----
# Header 2 ----
```
  
  ![Example of an RStudio outline](resources/rstudio_toc.png)
  
### Modularize your Shiny code
- If your Shiny app is divided into multiple tabs or sections, it might make sense to wrap it into modules
- By modularizing, you divide a large Shiny app into multiple smaller pieces that are isolated from each other
- Modularization is a very advanced topic and there is an [entire chapter in Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html) -- but it is good to know that it's possible
  
![Example of a modularized app](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d9a229fec717ef7bfda8e17a9c9d4fdc66b8b08/953f7/diagrams/scaling-modules/after.png)
  
### Build your Shiny app as a package
- This tip is particularly useful for larger apps
- The idea is to build a robust scaffold around the Shiny app
- A number of R packages specialize on this task: [Rhino](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/) [golem](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/), and [leprechaun](https://leprechaun.opifex.org/)
- Benefits:
  - Automatically handles dependencies, no more `library` and `there is no package called ‘xxx’`
  - Facilitates sharing Shiny apps without deployment
  - Supports multiple Shiny apps in one app
  - Enables testing workflows and thus more robust code
  - All R code files in one place



# Data

-   To build your Shiny app, we suggest one of the following datasets

## Bring your own dataset

-   If you already have a dataset that you want to build an app around, feel free to do this today!

## European social survey - wave 9

-   We used this dataset alongside the workshop
-   It contains data on political trust, political spectrum, demographics, internet use, happiness, and income
-   The dataset contains `haven` labels which help understand the scales of each variables
-   Base information:
    -   Region: Europe
    -   Time: 2018
    -   Observations: 49,519
    -   Variables: 14
-   How to read the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(haven) # the haven package has to be attached
ess <- readRDS("ess_trust.rds")
ess
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
readRDS("data/ess_trust.rds")
```

## Guerry dataset

-   This dataset stems from the "Essay on the Moral Statistics of France" from 1830, written by André-Michel Guerry
-   It features a number of indicators of the so-called "moral statistics", including crime, literacy, wealth, donations, and more
-   The dataset is an `sf` dataset containing department polygons of 19th century France – it may thus be convenient for creating an app using `leaflet` maps
-   Base information:
    -   Region: France
    -   Time: 1815-1834
    -   Observations: 85
    -   Variables: 27
    -   Source: <https://sfdep.josiahparry.com/reference/guerry>
-   How to read the data:

```{r}
guerry <- readRDS(url("https://github.com/paulcbauer/shiny_workshop/raw/shiny_workshop_2024/data/guerry.rds"))
guerry
```

# Exercises

::: callout-note
#### Exercise 1: 11:15 - 12:00

Taking one of the datasets introduced above – ESS, Guerry, or your own dataset, reflect on a possible Shiny app that you can build using the dataset. Create a sketch and design a prototype of the user interface based on this sketch.
:::

::: callout-note
#### Exercise 2: 13:00 - 14:15

Based on the prototype developed in exercise 1, sketch a reactive graph. Try to implement this reactive system in the server function of your app.

#### Exercise 3: 14:30 - 15:30

Deploy the app created in the last exercise using either <https://www.shinyapps.io/> or `shinylive`.
